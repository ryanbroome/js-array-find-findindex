#js-array-find-findindex

<p> Had some trouble with removeUser(arr, callback)
<i>I was on the right track with attempting to find the index and then remove the object from the array based on that index, but I had trouble with getting that to work. </i>
I wasn't thinking of creating a new array via slice until checking the answer.
